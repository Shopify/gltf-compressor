glTF Compressor is an open source tool for compressing glTF files.

It offers a simple but powerful workflow that we frequently use at Shopify to optimize 3D models. The workflow is designed to help you answer this question:

> How much can I compress the textures of my model before it starts looking noticeably bad?

To achieve that, the tool exposes all the textures of your glTF file and allows you to change their:

- Image format (JPEG, PNG and WebP).
- Resolution.
- Quality.

All changes happen in realtime so you can see the effects right away. You can quickly compare the original model with the compressed one by holding/releasing the `C` key on your keyboard.

Additionally, this tool offers a few mesh and animation optimization options that can be applied on export.

We hope you find this tool as useful as we do.

## Acknowledgments

This tool relies heavily on Don McCurdy's fantastic [glTF Transform](https://gltf-transform.dev/) library.

It also borrows ideas and snippets of code from pmndrs' [glTF to JSX converter](https://gltf.pmnd.rs/) and various other pmndrs libraries like [drei](https://drei.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction).

The demo model of a couch was made by Eric Chadwick. It can be found [here](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Assets/tree/main/Models/ChairDamaskPurplegold).

Thank you for your amazing work!
